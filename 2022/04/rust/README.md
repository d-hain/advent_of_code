# This is my solution to AoC 2022 Day 4

## First Solution

In the file `first_solution_part1.rs` there is my initial solution of part 1 of the puzzle.
And the same for `first_solution_part2.rs`.
On this day I will be using the nom crate, which I have learned recently, to parse my strings.

(nom version "7.1.1" is included in my `Cargo.toml`)
